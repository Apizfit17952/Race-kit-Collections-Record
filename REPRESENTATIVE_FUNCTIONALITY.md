# Representative Functionality Implementation

## Overview

The representative functionality allows **someone else to collect race kits on behalf of runners**. This is essential for marathon events where runners might not be able to collect their kits personally due to travel, work, or other commitments.

## üèóÔ∏è **Database Structure**

### Tables Involved

#### 1. **`representatives` Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.representatives (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Representative's full name
  id_number TEXT NOT NULL,           -- ID number (IC, passport, etc.)
  id_type TEXT DEFAULT 'ic',         -- Type: 'ic', 'passport', 'driving_license'
  phone TEXT,                        -- Contact phone number
  relationship TEXT,                 -- Relationship to runner (e.g., "spouse", "friend")
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. **`kit_collections` Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.kit_collections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  race_kit_id UUID REFERENCES race_kits(id),
  collected_by_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),  -- Staff member who processed
  representative_id UUID REFERENCES representatives(id), -- NULL for self-collection
  collection_type TEXT DEFAULT 'self',                   -- 'self' or 'representative'
  notes TEXT,                                            -- Additional notes
  collected_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üîç **Data Tracking**

- **representative_id**: Which representative collected (NULL for self)
- **collection_type**: 'self' or 'representative'

### **Audit Trail**
The system maintains a complete audit trail:
- Who collected the kit (staff member)
- When it was collected (timestamp)
- How it was collected (self or representative)
- Who collected it (runner or representative details)
- Any additional notes

## üéØ **Benefits**
