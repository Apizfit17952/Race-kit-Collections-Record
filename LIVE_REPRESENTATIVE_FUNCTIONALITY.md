# Live Representative Functionality

## Overview

The representative functionality has been simplified to support **live representative entry during kit collection**. Instead of pre-creating representatives, staff members enter representative details in real-time when the representative is physically present for collection.

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **Collection Process**

#### **Self Collection**:
1. Staff clicks "Collect Kit" on a pending race kit
2. Collection dialog opens with "Self Collection" selected by default
3. Staff can add optional notes
4. Staff clicks "Collect Kit" to complete the process
5. Kit status automatically changes to "collected"

#### **Representative Collection (Live Entry)**:
1. Staff clicks "Collect Kit" on a pending race kit
2. Collection dialog opens
3. Staff selects "Representative Collection"
4. **Representative details form appears** with fields:
   - Full Name (required)
   - ID Number (required)
   - ID Type (IC, Passport, Driving License)
   - Phone Number (optional)
   - Relationship to Runner (optional)
5. Staff enters representative details **as the representative is present**
6. Staff can add optional notes
7. Staff clicks "Collect Kit" to complete the process
8. **Representative is automatically created** in the database
9. Kit status automatically changes to "collected"

## üèóÔ∏è **Database Structure**

### **Tables Used**

#### 1. **`representatives` Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.representatives (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Representative's full name
  id_number TEXT NOT NULL,           -- ID number (IC, passport, etc.)
  id_type TEXT DEFAULT 'ic',         -- Type: 'ic', 'passport', 'driving_license'
  phone TEXT,                        -- Contact phone number
  relationship TEXT,                 -- Relationship to runner
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. **`kit_collections` Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.kit_collections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  race_kit_id UUID REFERENCES race_kits(id),
  collected_by_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),  -- Staff member who processed
  representative_id UUID REFERENCES representatives(id), -- NULL for self-collection
  collection_type TEXT DEFAULT 'self',                   -- 'self' or 'representative'
  notes TEXT,                                            -- Additional notes
  collected_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üìä **Data Tracking**

### **Collection Records**
Every kit collection creates records in both tables:

**`representatives` table** (for representative collections):
- Representative's personal information
- ID verification details
- Relationship to runner

**`kit_collections` table**:
- Which kit was collected
- Which staff member processed it
- Which representative collected it (if applicable)
- Collection type (self or representative)
- Timestamp and notes

### **Audit Trail**
Complete tracking includes:
- **Who collected**: Staff member processing the collection
- **When collected**: Exact timestamp
- **How collected**: Self or representative collection
- **Representative details**: Full information if representative collection
- **Verification**: ID type and number for representative collections

## üéØ **Benefits of Live Entry**

4. **Secure**: ID verification happens during collection
5. **Simple**: No complex representative management system needed
6. **Accurate**: Information entered directly from ID documents
7. **Efficient**: Streamlined process for staff

### **Use Cases**

2. **Representative Collection**:
   - Collect kit using representative
   - Enter all representative details
   - Verify representative is created in database
   - Verify collection record is created
   - Verify kit status changes to "collected"

   - Test with different ID types

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Representative with minimal information (only name and ID)
   - Representative with full information
   - Collection with extensive notes

## üìù **Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements for the live representative functionality:
